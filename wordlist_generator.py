## Wordlist generation using text files as sources of words
## Author: JG
## Date: Nov 2018

## This script will parse any text files that it finds in the present directory
## and any subdirectories of that directory, and will create a wordlist from those
## text files of all of the unique words it finds inside the files in alphabetical order.
## The wordlists will be saved with the original filename, with the phrase
## '-sorted-wordlist' appended to it, in a folder called 'Parsed Wordlists'

## The script will then combine all of the wordlists into a 'master wordlist'
## which is again sorted alphabetically.
