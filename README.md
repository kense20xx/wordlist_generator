# wordlist_generator
Python script to create wordlists from text files.

A quick and dirty script for scanning through directories to look for .txt. and .rtf files, parse the contents, and create lists of each unique word found inside the files.

The script creates a wordlist for each file it finds, and then a 'master' list that combines all of the lists together.
